                    This is an animated sitcom about the antics of a dysfunctional family. 
                    Homer is the oafish unhealthy beer loving father, 
                    Marge is the hardworking homemaker wife, 
                    Bart is the perpetual ten-year-old underachiever 
                    (and proud of it), Lisa is the unappreciated eight-year-old genius, 
                    and Maggie is the cute, pacifier loving silent infant.

                    I was hesitant to give this the rating I did, but from reading other audience reviews, 
                    my review actually will come across as far more... lenient. 
                    What can I say that hasn't been said already, 
                    the golden age of The Simpsons (seasons 3-8) is flawless television. 
                    Going through it again, it was awe inspiring to me how they manage to structure joke upon joke upon joke upon joke, 
                    something that must've been a complete breath of fresh air considering the boring, 
                    lifeless, milk-toast excuses for comedy shows that were coming around at that time. 
                    Yeah, those ones using canned laughter which relied completely on actors and people being...

                <p style="font-size: 25px;">It started off fantastic...</p>
                <p>
                    No one, not even Matt Groening himself, 
                    could've imagined that The Simpsons would become as big as it did. 
                    Nor could anyone anticipate it could become so cultural. 
                    "D'oh" is in the dictionary, 
                    and it has spawned off several catch-phrases and one liners.
                     Truly, The Simpsons is the biggest thing since Seinfeld! 
                     The first three seasons showed them as if they were...
                     an actual family. Like the kind of family you'd meet on the street (only a lot more dysfunctional). Homer trying to do the fatherly thing in each episode. 
                     Marge being the voice of reason all the time.
                      Lisa and Bart with their sibling rivalry...

                <p style="font-size: 25px;">This Show Will Be Used to Study How Life Was 100 Years From Now</p>
                <P>Brilliant television series that could probably be best described as "The Flintstones" gone stark-raving mad. 
                "The Simpsons", everyone knows them. Some love the series and some could care less about it. 
                Love it or hate it, it is near impossible to criticize the intelligence and creativity of this series. 
                The titled animated family makes their home in Springfield, USA and gets into situations that are seemingly more outlandish and crazier than the previous adventure.
                 Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are still going strong after nearly a dozen years of television life and with each passing moment...

                <p style="font-size: 25px;">A brilliant show that should be allowed to die</p>
                <P>What can I say about the Simpsons? Initially, let's start with the positives. 
                    Has there ever quite been a show like the Simpsons? 
                    I think not! Matt Groening and James L. 
                    Brooks have truly created something of great comical and philosophical magnitude.
                     From seasons 1-13 (that's right, up to season 13!), comedy appropriate to the society was cleverly exploited, 
                     causing the Simpsons to become a global phenomenon for obvious reasons. 
                     Flaws in society were excavated; puns were dished out with a clean edge and, most profoundly, 
                     this was a cartoon that both enticed adults and children alike...

                <p style="font-size: 25px;">Awkward feelings</p>
                <P>I have to start off by saying that seasons 1-9 of the Simpsons were absolutely fantastic, 
                    easily some of the best television i have ever seen. the writing was sharp and witty, 
                    the characters unpredictable and to some degree you could relate to them. 
                    I don't think anyone can deny that the Simpsons is probably the most famous TV show ever. 
                    even people who don't watch the show have heard about it or can name a few of the characters whether it be Homer,
                     Bart or Marge, THAT IS HOW POWERFUL THIS SHOW HAS BECOME. 
                     After all the success of the TV show it was inevitable that eventually a movie would be made, but to talk...
