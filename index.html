                <p>This is an animated sitcom about the antics of a dysfunctional family. 
                    Homer is the oafish unhealthy beer loving father, 
                    Marge is the hardworking homemaker wife, 
                    Bart is the perpetual ten-year-old underachiever 
                    (and proud of it), Lisa is the unappreciated eight-year-old genius, 
                    and Maggie is the cute, pacifier loving silent infant.</p>

                    What can I say that hasn't been said already, 
                    the golden age of The Simpsons (seasons 3-8) is flawless television. 
                    Going through it again, it was awe inspiring to me how they manage to structure joke upon joke upon joke upon joke, 
                    something that must've been a complete breath of fresh air considering the boring, 
                    lifeless, milk-toast excuses for comedy shows that were coming around at that time. 
                    Yeah, those ones using canned laughter which relied completely on actors and people being...
